Eligibility Index
==================
The “eligibility index” is a calculation that universities use to determine whether an applicant is eligible for admission or not. The index is based on high school grade point average (GPA) and test scores (SAT or ACT). The formula to compute the eligibility index varies depending on the type of test score.

Using SAT
---------
- Eligibility Index = GPA x 800 + SAT score
- For this example, assume applicants need a minimum eligibility index of **3000** using SAT score.

Using ACT
---------
- Eligibility Index = GPA x 200 + 10 x ACT score
- For this example, assume applicants need a minimum eligibility index of **718** using ACT score.

Implementation
--------------
This implementation uses JUnit 5 to take advantage of the new approach for parameterized tests
