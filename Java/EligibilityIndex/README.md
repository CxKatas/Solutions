Eligibility Index
==================
The “eligibility index” is a calculation that universities use to determine whether an applicant is eligible for admission or not. 

It is based on high school grade point average (GPA) and test scores (SAT or ACT). The formula to compute the eligibility index varies depending on the type of test score.

Using SAT
---------
- Eligibility Index = GPA x 800 + SAT score
- Applicants need a minimum eligibility index of **3000** using the SAT.

Using ACT
---------
- Eligibility Index = GPA x 200 + 10 x ACT score
- Applicants need a minimum eligibility index of **718** using the ACT.

Implementation
--------------
This implementation uses JUnit 5 to take advantage of the new approach for parameterized tests
